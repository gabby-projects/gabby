# Releasing Gabby

Gabby publishes the `gabby-ai` distribution to PyPI through GitHub Actions Trusted
Publishing. Release builds run the platform and quality checks before building the wheel and source
distribution. The isolated build job creates a signed SLSA provenance attestation for both files and
generates a CycloneDX SBOM from the locked runtime dependency graph. GitHub's OIDC-backed Sigstore
integration attests that SBOM against both distributions. The SBOM is retained as a separate
workflow artifact so the PyPI publisher receives only installable distributions. The publishing job
receives a separate OIDC token only after those checks pass and the `pypi` GitHub environment
approves the deployment.

The first alpha was published as PEP 440 version `0.1.0a1`, corresponding to Git tag
`v0.1.0a1`. The current planned beta uses version `0.1.0b1` and matching tag `v0.1.0b1`.
Both are Python pre-releases; package installers may require consumers to opt in to pre-release
versions. The final `0.1.0` version remains reserved for a later stable release after beta feedback
and compatibility decisions are addressed.

## One-time repository setup

1. Create a GitHub environment named `pypi` and require maintainer approval before deployment.
   Restrict deployments to version tags matching `v*`.
2. Configure PyPI Trusted Publishing for the `gabby-ai` project with this GitHub owner,
   repository, workflow filename `.github/workflows/release.yml`, and environment `pypi`.
3. Protect the `main` branch and version tags so only maintainers can change release inputs.
4. Do not add a PyPI API token to GitHub secrets. The publishing job uses GitHub OIDC.

See PyPI's [Trusted Publishers guide](https://docs.pypi.org/trusted-publishers/) and the
[GitHub Actions OIDC guide for PyPI](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/secure-your-work/security-harden-deployments/oidc-in-pypi)
for configuring the external trust relationship.

## Release procedure

1. Update `project.version` in `pyproject.toml` and add the release heading and notes to
   `CHANGELOG.md`.
2. Merge the release commit into `main` and wait for normal CI to pass.
3. Create and push the matching annotated tag, such as `v0.1.0b1`, on that commit. Python
   pre-releases use PEP 440 versions so installers can distinguish them from final releases and
   normally require an explicit pre-release opt-in.
4. The Release workflow repeats platform tests and quality gates for the tagged source, confirms the
   tag is on `main` and matches `project.version`, builds wheel and source distribution files,
   creates signed provenance attestations for both distributions, and generates and attests a
   CycloneDX SBOM from the production dependency graph in `uv.lock`.
5. Review and approve the deployment in the protected `pypi` environment. The publisher uploads
   only the prebuilt distributions and does not check out or execute project code.
6. Download each PyPI distribution and verify its GitHub attestation, for example:

   ```sh
   gh attestation verify dist/gabby_ai-<version>-py3-none-any.whl --repo OWNER/REPO
   gh attestation verify dist/gabby_ai-<version>.tar.gz --repo OWNER/REPO
   ```

   Download the `gabby-runtime-sbom` artifact from the same Release workflow run and verify that its
   SBOM attestation is associated with each distribution:

   ```sh
   gh attestation verify dist/gabby_ai-<version>-py3-none-any.whl \
     --repo OWNER/REPO --predicate-type https://cyclonedx.org/bom
   gh attestation verify dist/gabby_ai-<version>.tar.gz \
     --repo OWNER/REPO --predicate-type https://cyclonedx.org/bom
   ```

   Confirm the PyPI release and its provenance, then create the corresponding GitHub release with
   the changelog notes.

The SBOM describes the resolved core and `server` extra dependency graph selected by the lockfile
and includes Gabby's package as the root component. It does not describe optional development tools
or prove that dependencies are safe. `uv export` emits CycloneDX 1.5 through its SBOM export
feature; CI checks that this export remains part of the release workflow.

The workflow does not create or move Git tags, edit the changelog, or create a GitHub release. A
failed gate blocks publishing; correct the source and issue a new version tag rather than reusing a
published version.

See GitHub's [`actions/attest` documentation](https://github.com/actions/attest),
[`uv export` documentation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/projects/export/), and
[`gh attestation verify` manual](https://cli.github.com/manual/gh_attestation_verify) for
attestation generation and verification behavior.
